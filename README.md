**EasterEggs.js**

EasterEggs.js is a lightweight Node.js package designed to seamlessly integrate Easter eggs into your JavaScript or TypeScript web applications. With just a few lines of code, you can easily add interactive Easter eggs that trigger delightful surprises, such as displaying GIFs or images in a modal window.

### Installation

You can install EasterEggs.js via npm:

```bash
npm install easter-eggs-js
```

### Usage

To integrate Easter eggs into your web application, follow these simple steps:

1. Import the necessary classes from EasterEggs.js:

```javascript
import { ActionHandler, EasterModalActionHandler, EasterBuilder } from 'easter-eggs-js';
```

2. Set up the Easter egg functionality in your application, specifying the GIF or image you want to display:

```javascript
// Define the action handler
const actionHandler = new EasterModalActionHandler("./assets/giphy.gif");

// Create an EasterBuilder instance and add click triggers
const easterBuilder = new EasterBuilder(actionHandler)
  .addClickTrigger("easter-button")
  .addClickTrigger("easter-button2")
  .addClickTrigger("easter-button3")
  .addClickTrigger("easter-button4");
```

3. Ensure that the Easter egg functionality is initialized after the DOM has loaded, for example, in an Angular component's `ngAfterViewInit()` method:

```javascript
import { Component, AfterViewInit } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']
})
export class AppComponent implements AfterViewInit {

  ngAfterViewInit(): void {
    window.onload = () => {
      // Easter egg setup code here
    }
  }
}
```

### Features
